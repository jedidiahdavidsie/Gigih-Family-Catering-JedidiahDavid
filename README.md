Hello -- here's my submitted assignment for Gigih's backend final technical class project. It is a website that can store menus/dishes, menu categories, and orders. 

- You could try restarting the database anew with ``ruby
rake db:migrate:reset``. If you do, please populate some dishes categories first, then populate some dishes. Only then can you add dishes to each orders.

- On the Dashboard page, enter new order by entering the customer's email. The newly created order record will be displayed in the orders table. Click on each order's details page to add the menu/dishes that are ordered by the customer. You can also confirm whether the order has been paid or been canceled there.

- On the Reports page, you'll initially be presented with all the orders, regardless of their confirmation status. By choosing either of the four filtering radio, and entering the information for that option, you can filter the invoices to only present the ones that are PAID and meet the criteria of your filter.
